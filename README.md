# Titanic Survival Prediction Model
A TensorFlow Neural Network which predicts whether a passenger will survive the Titanic disaster based on their ticket class, sex, age, number of siblings, number of parents, passenger fare and the port they embarked from.

The model is trained on [Kaggle's Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/).
